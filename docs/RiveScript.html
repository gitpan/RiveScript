<h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>RiveScript is a simple trigger/response language primarily used for the creation
of chatting robots. It's designed to have an easy-to-learn syntax but provide a
lot of power and flexibility. For more information, visit
<a href="http://www.rivescript.com/">http://www.rivescript.com/</a></p>

<h2><a name="general">GENERAL</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="new" class="item">new (ARGS)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Create a new instance of a RiveScript interpreter. The instance will become its
own &quot;chatterbot,&quot; with its own set of responses and user variables. You can pass
in any global variables here. The two standard variables are:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  debug     - Turns on debug mode (a LOT of information will be printed to the
              terminal!). Default is 0 (disabled).
  verbose   - When debug mode is on, all debug output will be printed to the
              terminal if 'verbose' is also true. The default value is 1.
  debugfile - Optional: paired with debug mode, all debug output is also written
              to this file name. Since debug mode prints such a large amount of
              data, it is often more practical to have the output go to an
              external file for later review. Default is '' (no file).
  depth     - Determines the recursion depth limit when following a trail of replies
              that point to other replies. Default is 50.</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>It's recommended that if you set any other global variables that you do so by
calling <a href="#setglobal"><code>setGlobal</code></a> or defining it within the RiveScript code. This will avoid
the possibility of overriding reserved globals. Currently, these variable names
are reserved:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  topics   sorted  sortsthat  sortedthat  thats
  arrays   subs    person     client      bot
  objects  syntax  sortlist   reserved    debugopts
  frozen</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Note: the options &quot;verbose&quot; and &quot;debugfile&quot;, when provided, are noted and then
deleted from the root object space, so that if your RiveScript code uses variables
by the same values it won't conflict with the values that you passed here.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="loading_and_parsing">LOADING AND PARSING</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="loaddirectory" class="item">loadDirectory ($PATH[,@EXTS])</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Load a directory full of RiveScript documents. <code>$PATH</code> must be a path to a
directory. <code>@EXTS</code> is optionally an array containing file extensions, including
the dot. By default <code>@EXTS</code> is <code>('.rs')</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Returns true on success, false on failure.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="loadfile" class="item">loadFile ($PATH)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Load a single RiveScript document. <code>$PATH</code> should be the path to a valid
RiveScript file. Returns true on success; false otherwise.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="stream" class="item">stream ($CODE)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Stream RiveScript code directly into the module. This is for providing RS code
from within the Perl script instead of from an external file. Returns true on
success.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="sortreplies" class="item">sortReplies</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Call this method after loading replies to create an internal sort buffer. This
is necessary for trigger matching purposes. If you fail to call this method
yourself, RiveScript will call it once when you request a reply. However, it
will complain loudly about it.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="configuration">CONFIGURATION</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="setsubroutine" class="item">setSubroutine ($NAME, $CODEREF)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Manually create a RiveScript object (a dynamic bit of Perl code that can be
provoked in a RiveScript response). <code>$NAME</code> should be a single-word,
alphanumeric string. <code>$CODEREF</code> should be a pointer to a subroutine or an
anonymous sub.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="setglobal" class="item">setGlobal (%DATA)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set one or more global variables, in hash form, where the keys are the variable
names and the values are their value. This subroutine will make sure that you
don't override any reserved global variables, and warn if that happens.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This is equivalent to <code>! global</code> in RiveScript code.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="setvariable" class="item">setVariable (%DATA)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set one or more bot variables (things that describe your bot's personality).</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This is equivalent to <code>! var</code> in RiveScript code.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="setsubstitution" class="item">setSubstitution (%DATA)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set one or more substitution patterns. The keys should be the original word, and
the value should be the word to substitute with it.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  $rs-&gt;setSubstitution (
    q{what's}  =&gt; 'what is',
    q{what're} =&gt; 'what are',
  );</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This is equivalent to <code>! sub</code> in RiveScript code.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="setperson" class="item">setPerson (%DATA)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set a person substitution. This is equivalent to <code>! person</code> in RiveScript code.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="setuservar" class="item">setUservar ($USER,%DATA)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Set a variable for a user. <code>$USER</code> should be their User ID, and <code>%DATA</code> is a
hash containing variable/value pairs.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This is like <code>&lt;set&gt;</code> for a specific user.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="getuservar" class="item">getUservar ($USER, $VAR)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This is an alias for getUservars, and is here because it makes more grammatical
sense.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="getuservars" class="item">getUservars ([$USER][, $VAR])</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Get all the variables about a user. If a username is provided, returns a hash
<strong>reference</strong> containing that user's information. Else, a hash reference of all
the users and their information is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You can optionally pass a second argument, <code>$VAR</code>, to get a specific variable
that belongs to the user. For instance, <a href="#getuservars"><code>getUservars (&quot;soandso&quot;, &quot;age&quot;)</code></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>This is like <code>&lt;get&gt;</code> for a specific user or for all users.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="clearuservars" class="item">clearUservars ([$USER])</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Clears all variables about <code>$USER</code>. If no <code>$USER</code> is provided, clears all
variables about all users.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="freezeuservars" class="item">freezeUservars ($USER)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Freeze the current state of variables for user <code>$USER</code>. This will back up the
user's current state (their variables and reply history). This won't statically
prevent the user's state from changing; it merely saves its current state. Then
use <a href="#thawuservars"><code>thawUservars()</code></a> to revert back to this previous state.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="thawuservars" class="item">thawUservars ($USER[, %OPTIONS])</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>If the variables for <code>$USER</code> were previously frozen, this method will restore
them to the state they were in when they were last frozen. It will then delete
the stored cache by default. The following options are accepted as an additional
hash of parameters (these options are mutually exclusive and you shouldn't use
both of them at the same time. If you do, &quot;discard&quot; will win.):</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  discard: Don't restore the user's state from the frozen copy, just delete the
           frozen copy.
  keep:    Keep the frozen copy even after restoring the user's state. With this
           you can repeatedly thawUservars on the same user to revert their state
           without having to keep freezing them again. On the next freeze, the
           last frozen state will be replaced with the new current state.</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Examples:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  # Delete the frozen cache but don't modify the user's variables.
  $rs-&gt;thawUservars (&quot;soandso&quot;, discard =&gt; 1);</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  # Restore the user's state from cache, but don't delete the cache.
  $rs-&gt;thawUservars (&quot;soandso&quot;, keep =&gt; 1);</pre>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="lastmatch" class="item">lastMatch ($USER)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>After fetching a reply for user <code>$USER</code>, the <a href="#lastmatch"><code>lastMatch</code></a> method will return the
raw text of the trigger that the user has matched with their reply. This function
may return undef in the event that the user <strong>did not</strong> match any trigger at all
(likely the last reply was &quot;<code>ERR: No Reply Matched</code>&quot; as well).</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="interaction">INTERACTION</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="reply" class="item">reply ($USER,$MESSAGE)</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Fetch a response to <code>$MESSAGE</code> from user <code>$USER</code>. RiveScript will take care of
lowercasing, running substitutions, and removing punctuation from the message.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Returns a response from the RiveScript brain.</p>
</dd>
</li>
</dl>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="internal">INTERNAL</a></h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="debug" class="item">debug ($MESSAGE) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Prints a debug message to the terminal. Called from within in debug mode.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="issue" class="item">issue ($MESSAGE) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Called internally to report an issue (similar to a warning). If debug mode is
active, it will print the issue to STDOUT with a # sign prepended. Otherwise,
the issue is sent to STDERR via <code>warn</code>.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="parse" class="item">parse ($FILENAME, $CODE) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This method is called internally to parse a file or streamed RiveScript code.
<code>$FILENAME</code> is only there so it can keep internal track of files and line
numbers, in case syntax errors appear.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="sortthattriggers_internal" class="item">sortThatTriggers *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This method sorts all the <code>+Trigger</code> lines that are paired with a common
<code>%Previous</code> line. This is necessary for when one question by the bot could
have multiple replies. I found a bug with the following RS code:</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  + how [are] you [doing]
  - I'm doing great, how are you?
  - Good -- how are you?
  - Fine, how are you?</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  + [*] @good [*]
  % * how are you
  - That's good. :-)</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  + [*] @bad [*]
  % * how are you
  - Aww. :-( What's the matter?</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<pre>
  + *
  % * how are you
  - I see...</pre>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>The effective trigger order was &quot;<code>[*] @good [*]</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>*</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>[*] @bad [*]</code>&quot;,
because there was no sort buffer and it was relying on Perl's hash sorting.
This method was introduced to fix that problem and sort these triggers too.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>You don't need to call this method yourself; it is called automatically
on a <a href="#sortreplies"><code>sortReplies()</code></a> request.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="sortlist" class="item">sortList ($NAME,@LIST) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This is used internally to sort arrays (namely, person and substitution pattern
arrays). Sets <code>$rs-</code>{sortlist}-&gt;{$NAME}&gt; to an array reference of the sorted
values in <code>@LIST</code>. The values are sorted by number of words from greatest to
smallest, with each group of same-word-count items sorted by length amongst
themselves.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="_getreply" class="item">_getreply ($USER,$MSG,%TAGS) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p><strong>Do NOT call this method yourself.</strong> This method assumes a few things about the
user's input that is taken care of by <a href="#reply"><code>reply()</code></a>. There is no reason to call
this method manually.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="_reply_regexp" class="item">_reply_regexp ($USER,$TRIGGER) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>This method takes a raw trigger <code>$TRIGGER</code> and formats it for a matching
attempt in a regular expression. It removes <code>{weight}</code> tags, processes arrays,
processes bot variables and other tags, and returns something ready for the
regular expression engine.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="processtags" class="item">processTags ($USER,$MSG,$REPLY,$STARS,$BOTSTARS) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Process tags in the bot's response. <code>$USER</code> and <code>$MSG</code> are the values
originally passed to the reply engine. <code>$REPLY</code> is the bot's raw response.
<code>$STARS</code> and <code>$BOTSTARS</code> are array references containing any wildcards matched
in a trigger or <code>%Previous</code> command, respectively. Returns a reply with all the
tags processed.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="_formatmessage" class="item">_formatMessage ($STRING) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Formats a message to prepare it for reply matching. Lowercases the string, runs
substitutions, and sanitizes what's left.</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="_stringutil" class="item">_stringUtil ($TYPE,$STRING) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Runs string modifiers on <code>$STRING</code> (uppercase, lowercase, sentence, formal).</p>
</dd>
</li>
<dt><strong><a name="_personsub" class="item">_personSub ($STRING) *Internal</a></strong>

<dd>
<p>Runs person substitutions on <code>$STRING</code>.</p>

<h1><a name="rivescript">RIVESCRIPT</a></h1>
<p>This interpreter tries its best to follow RiveScript standards. Currently it
supports RiveScript 2.0 documents. A current copy of the RiveScript working
draft is included with this package: see <a href="/RiveScript/WD.html">the RiveScript::WD manpage</a>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="error_messages">ERROR MESSAGES</a></h1>
<p>Most of the Perl warnings that the module will emit are self-explanatory, and
when parsing RiveScript files, file names and line numbers will be given. This
section of the manpage instead outlines error strings that may turn up in
responses to the bot's queries.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="err__deep_recursion_detected_">ERR: Deep Recursion Detected!</a></h2>
<p>The deep recursion depth limit has been reached (a response redirected to a
different trigger, which redirected somewhere else, etc.).</p>
<p>How to fix: override the global variable <code>depth</code>. This can be done via
<a href="#setglobal"><code>setGlobal</code></a> or in the RiveScript code:</p>
<pre>
  ! global depth = 100</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="err__no_reply_matched">ERR: No Reply Matched</a></h2>
<p>No match was found for the client's message.</p>
<p>How to fix: create a catch-all trigger of just <code>*</code>.</p>
<pre>
  + *
  - I don't know how to reply to that.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="err__no_reply_found">ERR: No Reply Found</a></h2>
<p>A match to the client's message was found, but no response to it was found. This
might mean you had a set of conditionals after it, and no <code>-Reply</code> to fall back
on, and every conditional returned false.</p>
<p>How to fix: make sure you have at least one <code>-Reply</code> to every <code>+Trigger</code>, even
if you don't expect that the <code>-Reply</code> will ever be used.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_err__can_t_modify_non_numeric_variable__var_">[ERR: Can't Modify Non-Numeric Variable $var]</a></h2>
<p>You called a math tag on a variable, and the current value of the variable
contains something that isn't a number.</p>
<p>How to fix: verify that the variable you're working with is a number. If
necessary, reset the variable via <code>&lt;set&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_err__math_can_t_add_non_numeric_value__value_">[ERR: Math Can't &quot;add&quot; Non-Numeric Value $value]</a></h2>
<p>(&quot;add&quot; may also be sub, mult, or div). You tried to run a math function on a
variable, but the value you used wasn't a number.</p>
<p>How to fix: verify that you're adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing
using numbers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_err__can_t_divide_by_zero_">[ERR: Can't Divide By Zero]</a></h2>
<p>A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag was found that attempted to divide a variable by zero.</p>
<p>How to fix: make sure your division isn't dividing by zero. If you're using a
variable to provide the divisor, validate that the variable isn't zero by using
a conditional.</p>
<pre>
  * &lt;get divisor&gt; == 0 =&gt; The divisor is zero so I can't do that.
  - &lt;div myvar=&lt;get divisor&gt;&gt;I divided the variable by &lt;get divisor&gt;.</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="_err__object_not_found_">[ERR: Object Not Found]</a></h2>
<p>RiveScript attempted to call an object that doesn't exist. This may be because a
syntax error in the object prevented Perl from evaluating it, or the object was
written in a different programming language.</p>
<p>How to fix: verify that the called object was loaded properly. You will receive
notifications on the terminal if the object failed to load for any reason.</p>

<h1><a name="changes">CHANGES</a></h1>
<pre>
  1.18  Dec 31 2008
  - Added support for topics to inherit their triggers from other topics.
    e.g. &gt; topic alpha inherits beta
  - Fixed some bugs related to !array with ^continue's, and expanded its
    functionality therein.
  - Updated the getUservars() function to optionally be able to get just a specific
    variable from the user's data. Added getUservar() as a grammatically correct
    alias to this new functionality.
  - Added the functions freezeUservars() and thawUservars() to back up and
    restore a user's variables.
  - Added the function lastMatch(), which returns the text of the trigger that
    matched the user's last message.
  - The # command for RiveScript comments has been deprecated in revision 7 of
    the RiveScript Working Draft. The Perl module will now emit warnings each
    time the # comments are processed.
  - Modified a couple of triggers in the default Eliza brain to improve matching
    issues therein.
  - +Triggers can contain user &lt;get&gt; tags now.
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.</pre>
<pre>
  1.17  Sep 15 2008
  - Updated the rsdemo tool to be more flexible as a general debugging and
    developing program. Also updated rsdemo and rsup to include POD documentation
    that can be read via `perldoc`.
  - Added a global variable $RiveScript::basedir which is the the path to your
    Perl lib/RiveScript folder. This is used by `rsdemo` as its default location
    to search for replies.
  - Tweak: Triggers of only # and _ can exist now alongside the old single-wildcard
    trigger of *.
  - Bugfix: The lookahead code would throw Perl warnings if the following line
    had a single space in it, but was otherwise empty.
  - Bugfix: Inline comment removing has been fixed.
  - Bugfix: In conditionals, any blank side of the equality will get a default
    value of &quot;undefined&quot;. This way you can use a matching array inside an optional
    and check if that &lt;star&gt; tag is defined.
    + i am wearing a [(@colors)] shirt
    * &lt;star&gt; ne undefined =&gt; Why are you wearing a &lt;star&gt; shirt?
    - What color is it?
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.</pre>
<pre>
  1.16  Jul 22 2008
  - New options to the constructor: 'verbose' and 'debugfile'. See the new()
    constructor for details.
  - Added new wildcard variants:
    * matches anything (previous behavior)
    # matches only numbers
    _ matches only letters
    So you can have a trigger like &quot;+ i am # years old&quot; and &quot;+ i am * years old&quot;,
    with the latter trigger telling them to try that again and use a NUMBER this
    time. :)
  - Bugfix: when there were multiple +trigger's that had a common %previous,
    there was no internal sort buffer for those +trigger's. As a result, matching
    wasn't very efficient. Added the method sortThatTriggers() to fix this.
  - Bugfix: tags weren't being processed in @Redirects when they really
    should've!
  - Bugfix: The ^Continue lookahead code wouldn't work if the next line began
    with a tab. Fixed!
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.</pre>

  1.15  Jun 19 2008
  - Person substitutions support multiple-word patterns now.
  - Message substititons also support multiple-word patterns now.
  - Added syntax tracking, so Deep Recursion errors can give you a filename and
    line number where the problem occurred.
  - Added a handler for detecting when a user was put into an empty topic.
  - Rearranged tag priority.
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.</pre>

  1.14  Apr  2 2008
  - Bugfix: If a BEGIN/request trigger didn't exist, RiveScript would not fetch
    any replies for the client's message. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: Tags weren't being re-processed for the text of the BEGIN statement,
    so i.e. {uppercase}{ok}{/uppercase} wasn't working as expected. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: RiveScript wasn't parsing out inline comments properly.
  - Rearranged tag priorities.
  - Optimization: When substituting &lt;star&gt;s in, an added bit of code will insert
    '' (nothing) if the variable is undefined. This prevents Perl warnings that
    occurred frequently with the Eliza brain.
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.</pre>
<pre>
  1.13  Mar 18 2008
  - Included an &quot;rsup&quot; script for upgrading old RiveScript code.
  - Attempted to fix the package for CPAN (1.12 was a broken upload).
  - Bugfix: &lt;bot&gt; didn't have higher priority than &lt;set&gt;, so
    i.e. &lt;set name=&lt;bot name&gt;&gt; wouldn't work as expected. Fixed.</pre>
<pre>
  1.12  Mar 16 2008
  - Initial beta release for a RiveScript 2.00 parser.</pre>
