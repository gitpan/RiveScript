Revision history for Perl extension RiveScript.

  1.18  Dec 31 2008
  - Added support for topics to inherit their triggers from other topics.
    e.g. > topic alpha inherits beta
  - Fixed some bugs related to !array with ^continue's, and expanded its
    functionality therein.
  - Updated the getUservars() function to optionally be able to get just a specific
    variable from the user's data. Added getUservar() as a grammatically correct
    alias to this new functionality.
  - Added the functions freezeUservars() and thawUservars() to back up and
    restore a user's variables.
  - Added the function lastMatch(), which returns the text of the trigger that
    matched the user's last message.
  - The # command for RiveScript comments has been deprecated in revision 7 of
    the RiveScript Working Draft. The Perl module will now emit warnings each
    time the # comments are processed.
  - Modified a couple of triggers in the default Eliza brain to improve matching
    issues therein.
  - +Triggers can contain user <get> tags now.
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.

  1.17  Sep 15 2008
  - Updated the rsdemo tool to be more flexible as a general debugging and
    developing program. Also updated rsdemo and rsup to include POD documentation
    that can be read via `perldoc`.
  - Added a global variable $RiveScript::basedir which is the the path to your
    Perl lib/RiveScript folder. This is used by `rsdemo` as its default location
    to search for replies.
  - Tweak: Triggers of only # and _ can exist now alongside the old single-wildcard
    trigger of *.
  - Bugfix: The lookahead code would throw Perl warnings if the following line
    had a single space in it, but was otherwise empty.
  - Bugfix: Inline comment removing has been fixed.
  - Bugfix: In conditionals, any blank side of the equality will get a default
    value of "undefined". This way you can use a matching array inside an optional
    and check if that <star> tag is defined.
    + i am wearing a [(@colors)] shirt
    * <star> ne undefined => Why are you wearing a <star> shirt?
    - What color is it?
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.

  1.16  Jul 22 2008
  - New options to the constructor: 'verbose' and 'debugfile'. See the new()
    constructor for details.
  - Added new wildcard variants:
    * matches anything (previous behavior)
    # matches only numbers
    _ matches only letters
    So you can have a trigger like "+ i am # years old" and "+ i am * years old",
    with the latter trigger telling them to try that again and use a NUMBER this
    time. :)
  - Bugfix: when there were multiple +trigger's that had a common %previous,
    there was no internal sort buffer for those +trigger's. As a result, matching
    wasn't very efficient. Added the method sortThatTriggers() to fix this.
  - Bugfix: tags weren't being processed in @Redirects when they really
    should've!
  - Bugfix: The ^Continue lookahead code wouldn't work if the next line began
    with a tab. Fixed!
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.

  1.15  Jun 19 2008
  - Person substitutions support multiple-word patterns now.
  - Message substititons also support multiple-word patterns now.
  - Added syntax tracking, so Deep Recursion errors can give you a filename and
    line number where the problem occurred.
  - Added a handler for detecting when a user was put into an empty topic.
  - Rearranged tag priority.
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.

  1.14  Apr  2 2008
  - Bugfix: If a BEGIN/request trigger didn't exist, RiveScript would not fetch
    any replies for the client's message. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: Tags weren't being re-processed for the text of the BEGIN statement,
    so i.e. {uppercase}{ok}{/uppercase} wasn't working as expected. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: RiveScript wasn't parsing out inline comments properly.
  - Rearranged tag priorities.
  - Optimization: When substituting <star>s in, an added bit of code will insert
    '' (nothing) if the variable is undefined. This prevents Perl warnings that
    occurred frequently with the Eliza brain.
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.

  1.13  Mar 18 2008
  - Included an "rsup" script for upgrading old RiveScript code.
  - Attempted to fix the package for CPAN (1.12 was a broken upload).
  - Bugfix: <bot> didn't have higher priority than <set>, so
    i.e. <set name=<bot name>> wouldn't work as expected. Fixed.

  1.12  Mar 16 2008
  - Initial beta release for a RiveScript 2.00 parser.
