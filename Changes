Revision history for Perl extension RiveScript.

  1.14  Apr  2 2008
  - Bugfix: If a BEGIN/request trigger didn't exist, RiveScript would not fetch
    any replies for the client's message. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: Tags weren't being re-processed for the text of the BEGIN statement,
    so i.e. {uppercase}{ok}{/uppercase} wasn't working as expected. Fixed.
  - Bugfix: RiveScript wasn't parsing out inline comments properly.
  - Rearranged tag priorities.
  - Optimization: When substituting <star>s in, an added bit of code will insert
    '' (nothing) if the variable is undefined. This prevents Perl warnings that
    occurred frequently with the Eliza brain.
  - Updated the RiveScript Working Draft.

  1.13  Mar 18 2008
  - Included an "rsup" script for upgrading old RiveScript code.
  - Attempted to fix the package for CPAN (1.12 was a broken upload).
  - Bugfix: <bot> didn't have higher priority than <set>, so
    i.e. <set name=<bot name>> wouldn't work as expected. Fixed.

  1.12  Mar 16 2008
  - Initial beta release for a RiveScript 2.00 parser.
