RiveScript-Perl
===============

INTRODUCTION
------------

This is the original RiveScript interpreter, written in Perl.
RiveScript is a scripting language for chatterbots, making it
easy to write trigger/response pairs for building up a bot's
intelligence.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

RPM BUILD
---------

To build a RedHat package file for installing RiveScript, use the
rpmbuild Perl script provided in the subversion repository.

	Usage: perl rpmbuild

This results in a slightly different RPM than what you'd get via
cpan2rpm or cpan2dist... along with installing the module in its
proper place in your Perl libs, it will also install the `rivescript`
and `rsup` utilities from the bin/ folder into your /usr/bin
directory.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

Nothing that isn't standard.
